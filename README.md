# Utilty_BMI
In this project, we have created two small utilities that calculate the BMI and assign a class based on it, using **Python** and **JavaScript**.

The aim is to compare the 2 utilities on the following points:

**-Development models.**

**-Syntax and readability.**

**-Performance efficiency.**

**-Scalability and maintainability.**

**-Security implications.**
