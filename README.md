# Utilty_BMI
In this project, we have created two small utilities that calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) and assign a class based on the value of the index.

The two utilities have been developed using two of the most common programming languages, **Python** and **JavaScript**, with the final aim of comparing them.

**Python** is a programming language widely known and used for its easy syntax, as it uses English to develop its code, and its versatility and readability. It can support different programming styles such as procedural, object-oriented and functional and, thanks to its many different free libraries, it is widely used for data analysis, data science and machine learning.

**JavaScript** is a programming language used to create a dynamic interface on the website. It runs directly on the browser, but it can be used in any IDE such as VsCode by using Node.js, which is an open-source cross-platform which allows users to run JS scripts outside the browser.

In particular, this report will aim to compare the two languages on the following points:

**-Development models.**

**-Syntax and readability.**

**-Performance efficiency.**

**-Scalability and maintainability.**

**-Security implications.**

**Python Utility**

The utility was designed and implemented using the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** paradigm. By structuring the code around a class, it creates a blueprint that encapsulates  data, such as BMI values and classification thresholds, and methods within a single reusable block of code.
One of the main features of this is the **encapsulation**, which allows code to be easier to manage, extend, and debug. 
Creating objects from the class allows the utility to improve its flexibility as it can handle multiple sets of data, but furthermore, this approach facilitates code reuse, allowing the utility to be imported and utilised in other projects simply by instantiating new objects with different input data. 
Overall, adopting OOP enhances maintainability, promotes clean code organisation, and supports scalability as the project grows or requirements evolve.

**JS Utility**

The utility was developed using the Procedural Programming paradigm. By structuring the code as a sequence of functions and linear execution steps, it organises the logic within a single functional unit. In this case, the BMI_calculator function encapsulates the core operations, such as computing BMI values and applying classification thresholds, within a reusable block of code. 
This function takes inputs, performs calculations, and returns results without relying on the creation of objects or classes.
User interaction is handled using Node.js’s readline module, which manages input and output directly within the terminal. By following a procedural approach, the code remains linear and easy to trace, making it well-suited for simple scripts. The logic executes step-by-step, with control over runtime behaviour tied to the current working directory and execution context, which the developer must consider during integration or deployment.
While this procedural structure simplifies development and testing in a Node.js environment, it may reduce the utility’s extensibility and reusability compared to an object-oriented design. However, for small-scale tasks, this approach enables rapid implementation and straightforward execution.
